# SamPWND


SamPWND will be a universal app availaible for Windows and Linux. The purpose of it is to aid in the rooting process of any Galaxy device that we can get a full engineering firmware of, when ran; with your device connected, and usb debugging enabled, it will download the required firmware pieces from a dedicated server, then run an automated rooting procedure. After all is said and done you should be greeted with a fully rooted and stable device upon final reboot!

Currently this is a work in progress but as time goes on an XDA thread will be opened up to discuss developement as well as ideas you as a user may want incorporated.
